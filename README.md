TESTING - DanO

Speaking broadly, our team has decided that the best strategy for implementing this tool is an application which will take in information on a system (number of nodes, hardware/software info, etc.) from an individual user. The tool will then take this data and compare it to information found on a platform such as CVE, and based on this comparison will return to the user C/B info and recommendations for improving or managing the system's security.
