## Purpose is to work on being able to re-size the run scan window

- Run scan window can now be resized by the user and the ratio will stay (mostly) the same

- Might change some of the font sizes, on my 32" full screen, output doesn't look great, but there isn't much to fill out empty space

- Looks rather good on a normal 1080p screen

- Added save button for user to save output table of vuln matches to a ms excel file

- Format for save output might be added later

- This now requires an extra python module to work, XlsxWriter. This module uses only standard libary

'''
pip install XlsxWriter
'''
